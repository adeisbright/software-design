# Introduction 

Designing Quality Software entails a lot of fine-grained concepts that are only 
better understood through example implementations. 

To have a better feel of how to do these designs, I try to run them in more than one 
playground utilizing several examples. 

You can switch between one context to the other and run the examples as you wish. 

### Run Java 

For Java, to run the java code  , do the following :

$ javac Main.java

$ java Main.java 

### Run TS 

To run the tsc examples, do this :

$ tsc 

The command above will compile all tsc files and output them to the dist/ folder
